		<h1>Trees</h1>
		As trees grow, they help stop climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air, storing carbon in the trees and soil, and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.

	
		Trees on average produce an average of 260 pounds of oxygen per year This will support 13 oxygen tanks that can be used for COVID-19 patients.
